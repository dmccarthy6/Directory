1. Focus Areas:
- My focus when creating the application was on both app architecture, and performance. I tried to keep the UI simple given the data I was working with. I also tried to optimize the code if the scope of the project should expand.  

2. Copied Code:
- No outside code copied into the project.
- I did use some outside resources to effectively load images in the tableview, as well as utilizing generics for JSON decoding. These are two areas I have been wanted to dive deeper into and this project gave me the change to do that.

3. Tablet/Phone Focus:
-I focused on the phone while developing but I used programatic autoLayout while I was coding so the application runs on both the phone and the iPad.

4. How long you spent on project?
- I spent about 5 hours on the basic functionality but I wanted to go above and beyond so I spent a lot of time refactoring and improving the code where I could. 

5. Anything else to share?
    - I left a Unit Test in my code that hits the actual network (commented out). For my network unit tests I used a Mock URLSession to test various things, but I know API's can change without notice in the real world.
    - I had a lot of fun writing this project out, thank you for the opportunity!
