1. Focus Areas:
    - My focus when creating the application was on both app architecture, and performance. I tried to keep the UI simple given the data I was working with.

2. Copied Code:
    - None. I did use outside resources to help with efficiently loading images on the tableView cells and utilizing generics for JSON decoding. These are two things I have been looking to learn more so I was happy to dig into that a little bit. I utilized those resources and adapted them into my project but did not copy any of the code directly. I'm happy to discuss more or share the resources if needed!
    
    
3. Tablet/Phone Focus:
    -I focused on the phone while developing.


4. How long you spent on project?
    - I spent
    

5. Anything else to share?
    - I left a Unit Test in my code that hits the network (commented out). For my network unit tests I used a Mock URLSession to test various things, but I know API's can change without notice in the real world.
    - To test the Empty/Malformed data you can go to 'DirectoryModelController' and change the 'from' property in fetchDirectoryNames(from:) to '.empty' or '.malformed'
    - This was a great project, a lot of fun to get this one to work well! I got to learn a few things I've had on my list!
