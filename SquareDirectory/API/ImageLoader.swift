/* This class is used to load images to the TableView efficiently while taking dequeueing into account.
 - 'runningRequests' used to keep trac of URLSession tasks that are running when fetching image(s). Adding these tasks to runningRequests(dictionary) to keep track of them so I can cancel the task if the cell is out of view and the cell needs to reload data. This will enable the cell to load new images immediately.
 - Caching images so I don't hit the network more often than needed to increase performance and not expend users data unnecessarily.
 - Providing a function to cancel loading the image if the user is scrolling through the tableView and cells are being dequeued.
